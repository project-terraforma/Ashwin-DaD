## OVERTURE MAPS FOUNDATION OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Overture Maps Foundation is an open data initiative that provides free,
interoperable geospatial datasets for mapping applications worldwide. The data
is released as GeoParquet files with a JSON schema definition, using GeoJSON
as the canonical geospatial format.

### THE SIX DATA THEMES

**1. ADDRESSES**
   - Over 446 million address points from 34 countries worldwide
   - Simplified, worldwide address schema based primarily on OpenAddresses
   - Includes hierarchical administrative levels (address_level_1, 2, 3)

**2. BUILDINGS**
   - 2.54 billion building footprints globally
   - Categorized by use (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.)
   - Sources: Google Open Buildings, Microsoft ML Buildings, OpenStreetMap
   - Includes detailed attributes: height, floors, construction details

**3. PLACES**
   - 65.3 million points of interest worldwide
   - Businesses, landmarks, amenities, and services
   - Confidence scores indicate data quality (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Primary sources: Meta, Microsoft

**4. DIVISIONS**
   - 5.5 million administrative boundaries
   - Nine administrative levels: country → dependency → region → county →
     localadmin → locality → macrohood → neighborhood → microhood
   - Translated into 40+ languages
   - Includes population data and administrative hierarchies

**5. TRANSPORTATION**
   - 710 million transportation features
   - 327 million road/rail/water segments
   - 383 million connectors (intersection points)
   - Detailed routing attributes: speed limits, access restrictions, surface types

**6. BASE**
   - 758 million contextual features
   - Six feature types: land, water, land_cover, land_use, infrastructure, bathymetry
   - Includes natural features (forests, streams) and infrastructure (bridges, power lines)
   - Land cover from ESA WorldCover 2020 (10m resolution)

  - Forest: 11,560,632 (1.82%)

**Data Sources**:
  - OpenStreetMap: 634,801,338 (83.73%)
  - ESA WorldCover: 123,302,114 (16.26%) - Satellite-derived land cover
  - ETOPO/GLOBathy: 59,963 (0.01%) - Ocean depth data

**Release Comparison** (vs. baseline):
  - Total Change: +0.53%
  - Added: 1,728,020 (0.39%)
  - Removed: 142,300 (0.03%)
  - Data Changed: 3,496,036 (0.79%)
  - Unchanged: 435,538,690 (98.81%)

**Key Insights**:
  - Infrastructure (power, barriers, transportation) dominates
  - Natural features (trees, forests, streams) are well represented
  - Land cover data from ESA provides global vegetation classification
  - Base theme had modest updates in this release (1.19% affected)

## SUGGESTED EXPLORATION PROMPTS
================================================================================

Use these prompts to begin exploring the Overture Maps data. Each prompt is
designed to leverage the statistics and schema information in this document.

### Geographic Distribution Queries

1. "Which countries have the highest concentration of Places data? Show me the
   top 10 countries and their percentages."

2. "Compare the distribution of Divisions data across China, India, and the
   United States. Which country has the most administrative divisions?"

3. "What percentage of global building data comes from each data source (Google,
   Microsoft, OpenStreetMap)?"

### Data Quality & Confidence

4. "What proportion of Places have high confidence scores (0.8 or above)? How
   many places are marked as permanently closed (confidence = 0.0)?"

5. "In the Buildings theme, how much data changed between releases? What
   percentage of buildings had attribute updates?"

### Category & Classification Analysis

6. "What are the top 10 most common building types globally? What percentage
   does residential housing represent?"

7. "For the Places theme, list the top 15 primary categories. How diverse is
   the category distribution?"

8. "In Transportation, what's the breakdown between road, rail, and water
   segments? What are the most common road classes?"

### Comparative Insights

9. "Compare the data source distribution across all six themes. Which theme
   relies most heavily on OpenStreetMap?"

10. "Across all themes, which had the most changes in the 2025-08-20.1 release?
    Which themes were completely unchanged?"

### Specialized Queries

11. "In the Base theme, what are the top infrastructure features? How many
    power-related features exist?"

12. "For the Divisions theme, what's the distribution across administrative
    levels? What percentage are localities vs neighborhoods?"

13. "In Transportation, how many road segments have a subclass designation?
    What are the most common subclasses?"

14. "Explain the relationship between building 'subtype' and 'class'. Give
    examples of how they differ."

15. "What does the 'confidence' score mean in the Places theme? How should I
    interpret a confidence of 0.5 vs 0.9?"

## DATA LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

**Geographic Coverage Gaps**:
  - Addresses: Only 34 countries currently covered (out of 195+ globally)
  - Places: US has 20% of all places; coverage varies significantly by country
  - Data density varies by region based on source data availability

**Data Source Biases**:
  - Urban areas generally have better coverage than rural areas
  - Developed countries have more comprehensive data than developing countries
  - OpenStreetMap coverage depends on contributor activity in each region

**Confidence & Quality**:
  - Places confidence scores should guide usage decisions
  - Machine learning-derived buildings may have classification errors
  - Multiple data sources provide validation but may also introduce conflicts

**Temporal Considerations**:
  - Data reflects snapshot at release date (2025-08-20)
  - "Unchanged" doesn't mean data is current, only that it didn't change between releases
  - Real-world changes may not yet be reflected in the dataset

**Schema Complexity**:
  - Some themes have very diverse categorical values (e.g., 2,079 place categories)
  - Address level meanings vary significantly by country
  - Not all features have complete attribute data


================================================================================
## TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

**Data Format**:
  - Released as GeoParquet files for efficient spatial queries
  - Schema defined in JSON format
  - GeoJSON is the canonical geospatial representation

**File Organization**:
  - Data partitioned by theme, then by type within theme
  - Metrics organized in row_counts subdirectories
  - Changelog statistics track release-to-release changes

**Statistical Methodology**:
  - Counts represent aggregated totals across all CSV partition files
  - Percentages calculated against theme-specific totals
  - Change statistics compare current release vs previous baseline
